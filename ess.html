            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <span>Our primary goal was to transform the paper-based process of managing the work schedules of
                government
                contractors into an electronic document management system.

                The system was designed to enable three main actions, <b>(1) contractors can create their schedules;
                    (2)
                    the
                    government can verify the schedules; (3) supervisors can access the system for
                    government/contractors to
                    track contractors’/employees’ absence records.</b></span>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <span>We set up multiple one-on-one sessions with three key users (two government employees who verified the
            shift schedules and monthly absences and one contractor/scheduler responsible for creating new schedules) to
            learn how they did their work and what challenges they encountered during the process. The findings later
            became a reference during the ideation process. We came up with a user flow for each process per role and a
            few proposals for the main functions.</span>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Government Employees:</b> Ensure all the schedules abide by the law and the construction finishes
                on time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Contractors’ Schedulers:</b> Arrange the schedule efficiently and manage employee attendance.</li>
            <li><b>Contractors:</b> Meet requests for time off.</li>
            <h4>Problems</h4>
            <span>Government Employees</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Spent a significant amount of time communicating with schedulers about problems with their shift
                    arrangements.</li>

                <li>Kept track of and made sure all schedules were submitted on time.</li>

                <li>Were precisely examining all the schedules monthly using Excel, which was time-consuming because
                    each project followed different shift patterns based on laws, e.g., two-week institution, four-week
                    institution.</li>
            </ul>

            <span>Contractors (Schedulers)</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Users accidentally edited the finished schedules, making spreadsheets prone to errors after the
                    examination.</li>

                <li>Schedulers needed to spend more time dealing with employees’ collective agreements than planning
                    their
                    schedules because everyone had different requests for time off.</li>
            </ul>
            <span> Meanwhile, from the interviews, we know that users are afraid of:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Adapting to a new system would require a significant learning curve.</li>

                <li>Important work materials might mistakenly be deleted.</li>

            <div class="flex-2-1 mg-24"><span>Objective: Foster collaboration and transparency among schedulers and contract
                    employees; empower
                    employees with faster responses to their time-off requests and fair overtime.</span></div>
            <div class="flex-2-1 mg-24"> <span>Solution: People associated with the process had role-based system log ins. We
                    provided

        <h4>Expected Journey Map</h4>
        <span>Whenever I encounter projects with various users and different goals, I create a journey map and
            the task
            flow of the primary goals in the system; both can help me map out the entire process. </span>
        <img src="img/ess/ejm.jpeg" alt="Expected Journey Map">
        <span>Then, using the journey map, I can go deeper into what they need to do to achieve the primary
            goals.</span>
        <h4>Task Flow</h4>
        <span>The flow shows the steps users will take to get to a specific goal or endpoint, ensuring that I
            design
            sequentially and thoroughly, which can help me distinguish who is in charge of different phases.
            Moreover, I
            can check details to make the system better. It acts as a precursor to designing potentially complex
            user
            flows. </span>
        <img src="img/ess/tf.jpeg" alt="Task Flow">
        <h4>Wireframe</h4>
        <span>I place the emphasis on what information should I request them to add in each section to this
            system.
        </span>
        <img src="img/ess/wf.jpeg" alt="Wireframe">
        <span>When I have listed out all the necessary information, I organize it into understandable, clear,
            and
            intuitive data. I additionally need to make sure the design is user-centric so that multiple users
            can
            complete their goals effortlessly.</span>

        <h3>Final Design And Spec</h3>
        <h4>Iteration Of The Adding Schedule Process</h4>
        <span>We tried multiple methods for the schedule management process and allowed potential users to directly edit
            on LiveServer. Finally, with limited time, I coded both prototypes.

            At first, we came up with a dropdown selection method since contractors often unconsciously edited the
            schedules and created version control problems. This method required choosing the right item precisely to
            edit and confirm, making schedules less prone to errors. However, the approach was inconvenient (needed two
            steps for each schedule) and it was hard to distinguish a day shift from a night shift (without colors).

            In my second attempt, I designed the color-picking method. This method is much similar to how they edited on
            the EXCEL previously. (video display below) </span>
        <h4>Set Up All The Information Needed To Add The Schedule</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To design correct interactions, buttons are important. We distinguish links and buttons. Links are used
                for
                navigating to another place, and buttons are used for performing an action. We set up different styles
                between them.</li>
            <li>Since there are multiple information formats, I used table structure in this adding information page.
                For
                consistency and ease of understanding, we match the alignment of headings to the alignment of the data
                and
                make the text aligned left in every table.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="img/ess/final1.jpeg" alt="">
        <ol>
            <li>Since the law regulation has limited the maximum working hours each week, we designed the label to
                distinguish one week from the other. If there is a national holiday, the label will turn red on the day.
            </li>
            <li>Horizontal and vertical scroll for them to edit the schedule more flexibly.</li>
            <li>Whenever they save the schedule. Our system will check and notify problems.</li>

                <span>I have learned to implement a table on the front end of an application with sorting, filtering,

                    pagination functions. I also developed a color-pick selection function.
                    Initially, I would look up libraries and ensure they had everything I needed, which is certainly a
                    viable option. Unfortunately, the libraries often do not match the design or requirements of
                    specific cases,
                    and have many features that I do not need. Consequently, a better option sometimes is to implement
                    it
                    independently to have complete flexibility over functionality and design. </span>

                <span><b>My Role in This Project</b><br>
                    I acted as a designer and front-end developer at the same time in this project. The truth is that it
                    is
                    not always cost-effective for one person to do a project from scratch. Conflicts may arise between
                    the two
                    roles. Sometimes, I knew that the design idea I had come up with would be time-consuming, which cost
                    me
                    a lot of time and effort to balance. However, I realize that possessing relevant background in both
                    areas is truly helpful; it allows me to
                    communicate well with the team and clients. Moreover, such a role benefits my design outcomes
                    because I
                    can incorporate the transitions and effects that best complement the design.<br>
                    <div class="bottomline"></div>
                    <b>A Design guideline is needed</b><br>
                    Although I standardized some design formats, such as the typography, font sizes, colors, inputs, and
                    buttons, I feel there are still many reusable components that I should organize, including the login
                    page, the navigation bar, and the tables. In this way, we could save a lot of time communicating
                    with clients
                    by merely showing all types of designs for them to assemble and build any application, which can
                    also
                    establish the style for our company.

                <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-2 pd-l-24">
                <span>After finishing every project, I am always questioning whether my design did
                    create
                    the
                    best solution, and sometimes it is quite hard to answer the question. Initially, working with the
                    government frustrated me
                    strongly. The project partners were new to digital products and had limited knowledge of creating
                    good
                    system experiences. However, I later realized that instead of being a problem-solving designer, I
                    should
                    think and act like a supporter to help and guide public servants tackle those challenges and better
                    understand the problem rather than provide them with an immediate solution. As a designer, there is
                    definitely no optimal solutions in design, yet with limited time and resource, I believed that we
                    had
                    come up with the best solution at that time.</span>
