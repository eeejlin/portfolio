            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <span>
                Our goal was to simplify government contractors' work schedule management by replacing paper-based
                processes with an electronic system. The system facilitated three key actions: <br>(1) contractors could
                create schedules <br>(2) the government could verify schedules <br>(3) supervisors could track absence
                records.</span>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <span>
            We conducted one-on-one interviews with three key users to understand work processes and challenges. Two
            government employees verified shift schedules and monthly absences, and one contractor/scheduler created new
            schedules. Insights from these interviews guided the ideation process. User flows were created for each
            role, and proposed main functions addressed identified issues.</span>

        <h4>Expected Journey Map</h4>
        <span>When dealing with projects involving diverse users and objectives, I develop a journey map and task flow
            for the primary goals of the system. Both help me visualize the entire process.</span>

        <span>Using the journey map, I can delve into the actions necessary to accomplish primary goals.</span>
        <h4>Task Flow</h4>
        <span>The flow outlines steps to achieve a specific goal, ensuring sequential and thorough design while
            clarifying responsible parties for each phase. Examining details in this way enhances the system and
            facilitates design of complex user flows. </span>

        <h4>Iteration Of The Adding Schedule Process</h4>
        <span>We tried multiple schedule management methods on LiveServer. With limited
            time, I coded both prototypes. A dropdown selection method was initially employed to reduce version control
            problems, but it required two steps for each schedule and lacked clear day/night shift differentiation. The
            color-picking method, mirroring previous Excel editing, was adopted in the second attempt. </span>
        <h4>Set Up All The Information Needed To Add The Schedule</h4>
        <span>Buttons are crucial for accurate interactions, with links for navigation and buttons for action, each
            with distinct styles. Table structure was employed for the information addition page to accommodate
            multiple formats. Headings were aligned with data, and text left-aligned for consistency and clarity.

                    As both designer and front-end developer, balancing roles and addressing conflicts can be
                    challenging and not always cost-effective. However, having relevant background in both areas enables
                    effective communication with the team and clients, and allows for design outcomes that complement
                    transitions and effects.<br>
                    <div class="bottomline"></div>
                    <b>A Design guideline is needed</b><br>
                    Standardizing design formats like typography, font sizes, colors, inputs, and buttons is beneficial.
                    Organizing reusable components like login page, navigation bar, and tables saves time in client
                    communication and enables easy assembly of designs for various applications. It also establishes a
                    company style.

                    with inexperienced government partners on digital products and system experiences was frustrating.
                    However, I learned my role as a supporter to help and guide public servants in tackling challenges
                    and understanding problems. Design has no optimal solutions, yet with limited time and resources, I
                    believe we arrived at the best solution at that time.</span>
