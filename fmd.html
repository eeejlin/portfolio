            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <span>Our primary goal was to enhance factory management, with this dashboard being one part of a larger
                system. It manages people and car flow, contractors, construction, and access control.</span>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <span>The project integrated disconnected data and progress into the system by interviewing multiple users and
            discussing client needs.</span>
    </section>
    <section id="UserGoal">
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <span>Based on interviews, we defined users, their motivations, tasks, and context of use (chart design shown
            below). Managers are the main users who require immediate and effective control of factory operations. They
            use a tablet computer while patrolling the factory, relying on data to assist their work. </span>

    <section id="Ideation">
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <span>Dashboards provide a quick overview of crucial information for users and enable easy navigation to areas
            requiring attention. To design the dashboard, we identified essential elements and classified data into
            three parts.</span>
        <ol>
            <li>Car Flow: Hourly car flow statistics to prevent parking shortages.</li>
            <li>Employees: Monitor employee statuses and overtime requests.</li>
            <li>Contractors: Track contractor details by factory department.</li>

                <span>To prevent user distraction from complex data, unnecessary styling was avoided. Contrasting colors
                    were used to distinguish classifications while maintaining readability. Consistent naming
                    conventions were followed to minimize confusion.</span>

                <span>We identified the purpose of each piece of information to choose the appropriate chart type and
                    x-axis value. For example, a line chart with time as the x-axis was used for car flow. We also
                    considered details such as the quantity of values and display options for each type of information
                    to avoid misinterpretation of data. </span>

                <span>Real-time information must update automatically for the dashboard to display current resources and
                    status. Unlike other systems where users log in and out, the dashboard serves as an immediate
                    control tool.</span>

                <span>Conflicts can arise when working with government decision makers whose desires contrast with user
                    needs or our design. In these instances, it's difficult to determine who is right, and the
                    development process can become a continual struggle until someone concedes for the sake of
                    completing the project. Ultimately, someone must hold authority over decisions. As a designer, I
                    strive to balance goals and desires, but when it doesn't work out, trust and respect are crucial. I
                    must believe that everyone shares the same objective of improving the product, even if we see things
                    from different perspectives.</span>

                <span><b>Cookie Settings</b><br>
                    Our system uses token-based authentication for better efficiency than storing tokens on the user's
                    end. However, this method poses a risk as attackers with the key can access all user data. To
                    mitigate this, our system requires users to access the Intranet and use factory-provided devices. I
                    gained knowledge on cookies, sessions, and authentication during this project. I integrated settings
                    and verified the cookie function on each page before loading information.

                    <b>“Apexchart” Plugin Implementation</b><br>
                    Customizing plugins to enhance the user experience was challenging, but I created several essential
                    functions not included in the original plugin. This involved reading documentation and coding the
                    design. For instance, I modified the bar chart plugin with a scrollbar on the x-axis and fixed bar
                    width to accommodate hundreds of values.

                <span><b>Definition of the Purpose of the Dashboard</b><br>
                    Designing dashboards for multiple enterprises with unique requirements has taught me that a clear
                    purpose is essential for a smooth design process. Identifying the purpose is the crucial first step
                    in every new project. <br>
                    <div class="bottomline"></div>
                    <b>Detailed Considerations</b><br>
                    Improving the dashboard design process is a continuous learning experience as it's easy to overlook
                    details. When attempting to standardize the process, I faced challenges as the data can vary in
                    small details, making decision-making complicated due to too many simultaneous factors to consider.
                    <div class="bottomline"></div>
                    <b>Responsive Web Design</b><br>
                    Creating a block dashboard that appears visually appealing on all devices is challenging. Designers
                    must ensure that all words and values are displayed clearly with sufficient margins, without any
                    distortion of the width or height.
